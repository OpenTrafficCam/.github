Welcome to OpenTrafficCam - the only fully integrated open source workflow for video-based recording and automated analysis of road traffic.

OpenTrafficCam consists of multiple modules.
The core is composed of three:

- The OTCamera hardware to record videos,
- OTVision, a collection of algorithms to generate trajectories of objects (road users) based on the videos and
- OTAnalytics to gather traffic measures based on these trajectories.

See [opentrafficcam.org](https://opentrafficcam.org) for further information :)

OpenTrafficCam is coordinated and lead developed by the German startup [platomo](https://platomo.de), a team of traffic engineers, software and hardware developers.
The core team also includes traffic and photogrammetry researchers from the [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/verkehr/ivs/msp).

OpenTrafficCam is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport as part of the research initiative mFUND.
